## End-to-end Video Text Detection, Tracking and Recognition

## Introduction
This is CMPE258 Deep Learning group project, which aims to build a full pipeline of Deep Learning application with model training.

Group Members:
- Jing Shu, jing.shu@sjsu.edu, (015941146)
- Sarah Yu, kunhong.yu@sjsu.edu, (016099252)
- Adeel Javed, adeel.javed@sjsu.edu, (014183143)

## Installation
The codebases are built on top of [TransDETR](https://github.com/weijiawu/TransDETR/tree/main), [Deformable DETR](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR) and [MOTR](https://github.com/megvii-model/MOTR).


## Citing

This code uses codes from TransDETR, MOTR, TransVTSpotter and EAST. Many thanks to their wonderful work:
